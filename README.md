This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing retail prices and attributes of approximately 10,000 cars.
The dataset includes various features such as make, model, year, engine type, and other specifications, along with the corresponding car prices.
The objective is to preprocess the data, explore relationships between variables, and visualize key insights.
For this analysis, I have utilized the MICE package for handling missing data and ggplot2 for data visualization.
